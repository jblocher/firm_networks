This is my original "FirmNetworks" project which is basically alpha code and mostly not useful anymore.
It manipulates matrices, but uses badly placed indicators and was for my Spring 2010 presentation to DNAC.
At this point, this is a historical archive, as Market Networks and Correlations have replaced it as of Fall 2010.
